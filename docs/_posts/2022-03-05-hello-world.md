I have been toying with the idea of assembling content for the public web for a while now.  At first, I thought it would be a neat way
to really learn the inner workings of HTTP.  I even considered going at it without any framework, hand coding HTML directly and slowly
evolving my own framework as I went.  Fortunately, I quickly realized that I'm much too lazy for that approach to go anywhere.  So I looked
for the highest ROI approach instead and settled on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).  You probably wonder how come you're not reading
this at the expected [https://jburgy.github.io](https://jburgy.github.io) address.  I realized a few years back that my last name ends like
the [Top-Level Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain) for [Guyana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.gy).  So I
naturally registered the corresponding domain.

With the question of "how" out of the way, the "what" remains.  At the risk of sounding like a total loser, I really enjoy writing bits of
software.  I derive satisfaction from approaching Saint-Exupery's idea that "La perfection est atteinte, non pas lorsqu'il n'y a plus rien à
ajouter, mais lorsqu'il n'y a plus rien à retirer."  So I try real hard to write programs which I consider elegant because of their minimalism.
Think of it as the software equivalent of [Barnett Newman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_Newman)'s paintings.

I therefore commit to post extremely sporadically to entertain and possibly educate.  Your feedback is always welcome.
